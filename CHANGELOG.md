# Changelog

All notable changes to Solo CEO are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.19.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Today Focus two-tier design** — split into "截止事项" (due/overdue items driven by real due dates) and "AI 推荐" (strategy-based revenue/delivery/system recommendations)
- **Entity linking** — focus items now link to their source: click a task → opens Work page task panel, click a lead → opens Leads page lead panel, click a memo → scrolls to and highlights the memo on the dashboard
- **Due/overdue enrichment** — tasks and memos with `due <= today` automatically surface in the top tier with urgency badges (red for overdue, amber for due today)
- **Navigate-to-entity event system** — WorkPage and LeadsBoard listen for `navigate-to-entity` CustomEvents to open entity panels from anywhere in the app
- **Memo highlight animation** — `highlight-pulse` CSS animation for scroll-to-memo navigation

---

## [2.18.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Memo scope toggle** — segmented control (工作/个人) in HomeMemoSection AI input and manual add form, allowing users to choose work or personal scope when creating memos from the dashboard

---

## [2.18.0] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- **Notion-style design system** — migrated from warm cream palette to Notion's clean white/gray design language (#ffffff bg, #37352f text, rgba borders, flat shadows)
- **Page tabs & segment switcher** — replaced background-fill active state with underline indicator (border-bottom: 2px solid)
- **Button active state** — replaced scale(0.97) transform with opacity: 0.7 for flatter feel
- **Card radius** — reduced from 16px to 6px across all card variants
- **Modal/BottomSheet radius** — reduced from 20/28px to 12px
- **Progress bars** — slimmed from 6px to 4px height
- **Sidebar** — neutral gray background, active item uses bg-tertiary instead of accent tint
- **Section labels** — removed uppercase and letter-spacing for quieter hierarchy
- **Mobile nav** — removed glass/blur effect, solid opaque background with border
- **All stat card icons** — replaced accent-tinted circles with neutral gray backgrounds
- **All AI input bars** — removed yellow tint, Bot icons use text-quaternary

### Fixed
- **Kanban drag-and-drop** — cards couldn't be dragged between columns in Tasks and Leads; added `useDroppable` to column containers (SortableContext alone doesn't create droppable zones)
- **Login after logout** — user menu now shows "登录/注册" button when logged out instead of requiring navigation to Settings
- **Undefined CSS variable** — `--layer-nav` referenced but never defined; replaced with `--layer-header`

### Removed
- **Neo-brutalist theme** — deleted `neo-brutalist.css` (914 lines) and theme switcher; unified on single Notion-style design
- Unused imports: `useCallback` (App.tsx), `useEffect`/`useUIStore` (QuickCreateMenu.tsx), `TouchSensor` (KanbanBoard/LeadsBoard), `Circle`/`Pencil` (HomeMemoSection)
- Dead `handleDragOver` callback in KanbanBoard

## [2.17.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Neo-brutalist input focus border too thick** — replaced heavy black 2px border + 2px ring focus state with golden yellow (#f5c518) border + 1px ring; affects login page and all text inputs

## [2.17.0] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- **Unified design language across both themes** — comprehensive audit ensuring every component follows its respective theme's design language consistently
- **Visual hierarchy overhaul** — Dashboard now has clear primary (KPIs) → secondary (Today's Focus) → tertiary (Growth System) content zones with section spacing
- **KPI typography system** — new `.kpi-value` / `.kpi-label` / `.kpi-sub` CSS classes with larger numbers (22→24px desktop), proper tracking, and neo-brutalist uppercase treatment
- **Sidebar floating layout** — increased margins (12px original, 8px neo-brutalist) for breathing room on all sides
- **Page tabs & segment switcher redesigned** — removed card-like active state (border+shadow) in original theme; both states now feel cohesive with subtle background indicator
- **Table styling via CSS** — client table headers, row borders, and hover states moved from inline styles to `.card table` CSS rules; works in both themes automatically
- **Badge variant system** — 6 semantic CSS classes (`badge-success`, `badge-warning`, `badge-danger`, `badge-accent`, `badge-blue`, `badge-orange`) replacing inline color-mix styles
- **Progress bar components** — new `.progress-track` / `.progress-fill` classes used in MonthlyGoal and BreakthroughSection; neo-brutalist adds 2px border
- **Protocol step states** — `.protocol-step`, `.protocol-done`, `.protocol-current` CSS classes replacing inline borderLeft/opacity
- **Icon circle components** — `.icon-circle-success` / `.icon-circle-danger` for transaction type indicators
- **Neo-brutalist theme polish** — KPI labels uppercase with letter-spacing, badge variants get border+shadow, tables get strong header separator with soft row dividers, sidebar gets floating margins

### Removed
- Inline `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` hover handlers on client table rows (CSS handles it)
- Inline `style={{ fontWeight }}` on table headers (CSS `.card table th` handles it)
- Inline badge color-mix styles across ClientList, TaskCard, TransactionList

## [2.16.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Switchable theme system** — new visual theme architecture via CSS custom properties + `data-theme` attribute, orthogonal to light/dark mode
- **Neo-Brutalist theme** — complete theme with zero border-radius, 2px hard borders, offset shadows, lime accent (#c8ff00), hot pink/cyan pops, mechanical animations, squared avatars, monospace section labels
- **Theme picker in Settings** — visual grid with live swatch previews showing bg/accent/border/radius/shadow per theme

### Fixed
- **Critical: sign-out data isolation** — sign-out now performs full 5-step cleanup: module caches → Supabase session → Zustand stores → offline queue + sql.js database → localStorage widget keys
- **Cross-user offline queue replay** — offline write queue is now cleared on sign-out, preventing User A's queued operations from replaying under User B's account
- **Cross-user local database leak** — sql.js in-memory database and IndexedDB persistence are now cleared on sign-out
- **Module-level cache race conditions** — `_cachedUserId` and `_cachedAuthed` are now explicitly reset before sign-out, eliminating timing windows where stale user IDs could route requests incorrectly
- **Avatar persisting across accounts** — all user-specific localStorage keys (countdowns, energy, focus-skipped) are now purged on sign-out; settings store fully reset (name, avatar, currency, timezone)

## [2.15.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Tax breakdown display everywhere** — all milestone amounts, transaction rows, mark-paid confirmation, and edit-paid panel now show pre-tax + tax + total when tax is configured
- **Paid milestone amount editing** — click a paid milestone to edit amount, date, and payment method without undo/redo; amount changes cascade to linked finance transaction with automatic tax recalculation
- **Edit-paid panel** — replaces inline editing with a dedicated popup panel (date, amount, payment method, undo)

### Fixed
- **12 finance calculation issues** (P0/P1/P2) — full audit of all money calculations across all pages
- **Subscription billing timing bug** — future-dated subscriptions no longer marked as "已完成" before billing date arrives
- **Project-level tax inheritance** — milestones and mark-paid now read tax settings from the project (not client), fixing cases where project has tax but client doesn't
- **Source-lock bypass** — milestone paid_date/amount edits cascade directly to linked finance_transaction without hitting the source-lock guard
- **Mark-paid API** — both online and offline handlers now check project-level tax_mode/tax_rate before falling back to client-level
- **i18n** — added 6 new keys for tax labels (taxExclusive, taxInclusive, editPaid, amountPreTax, amountInclTax, inclTax) in zh + en

## [2.14.1] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- **Widgets: all 4 enabled by default** — countdown widget now enabled on first install (migration v9 forces enable for existing users)

## [2.14.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Client panel UI overhaul** — master-level redesign with underline tabs, card selectors for billing type / status / payment method, unified `radius-12` design language
- **Client panel: project tab** — added project name field, balanced 2×2 grid layout (name + fee, start + end dates)
- **i18n: 4 new keys** — billing type and status hint text (zh + en)

### Fixed
- **Code audit: 15 issues resolved across Critical → Low severity**
  - **Offline api.ts validation** — added `str()` / `enumVal()` to all POST/PUT fields, matching supabase-api.ts (prevents data corruption)
  - **Subscription ledger sync** — preserves `status='已完成'` on existing transactions (prevents confirmed receipt overwrite)
  - **Milestone mark-paid** — offline path now writes `source: 'milestone'` to finance transaction (prevents source lock bypass)
  - **Milestone undo-paid** — added complete `/api/milestones/:id/undo-paid` route to offline api.ts
  - **Frontend diff-only PUT** — TaskDetail + LeadsBoard now compute diff and only send changed fields (prevents stale-data overwrites)
  - **Project PUT validation** — added `enumVal()` for `status` and `tax_mode` in supabase-api.ts
  - **Missing offline route** — added `/api/server-info` to api.ts
- **Type safety fixes**
  - `supabase-api.ts` — removed unsafe `as unknown as` double assertion for OverdueMilestoneRow
  - `main.tsx` — replaced `Record<string, any>` with proper Capacitor interface
  - `i18n/context.tsx` — removed unnecessary `requestIdleCallback` type assertion
- **AnimatePresence + createPortal** — replaced Fragment `<>` with keyed `motion.div` wrapper (Pattern A) in 5 files, enabling proper exit animations
- **Safe-area pattern** — wrapped fallback `env(safe-area-inset-top)` with `max()` in ClientList, LeadsBoard, TaskDetail
- **z-index** — sidebar changed from hardcoded `10` to `var(--layer-nav)`

### Changed
- **Sync manager** — `existingMap` type upgraded from `Map<string, number>` to `Map<string, { id: number; status: string }>` for status-aware ledger sync

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Offline api.ts — 6 PUT endpoints full overwrite → partial update** (CRITICAL data loss prevention)
  - Tasks PUT: dragging column offline no longer blanks title, AI fields, scope
  - Leads PUT: moving stage offline no longer blanks aiDraft, needs, website
  - Clients PUT: editing one field offline no longer resets all 20 fields
  - Finance PUT: editing amount offline no longer resets category, description, tax
  - Plans PUT: editing price offline no longer blanks features array
  - Milestones PUT: editing status offline no longer resets label, amount, dates
- **4 remaining raw `fetch('/api/...')` calls → `api.ts` utility** (BUSINESS_RULES Rule 9)
  - SettingsPage: 3 calls (save name, save avatar, clear avatar)
  - AppearanceSection: 1 call (server time sync check) — also fixed `.json()` on already-parsed response

### Changed
- **BUSINESS_RULES.md** expanded from 12 → 17 rules (added Rules 13–17: frontend PUT discipline, memo interaction pattern, safe-area insets, z-index layers, weekly report filtering)

### Removed
- `.claude/COWORK-RULES.md` (unused)
- `.claude/plans/optimization.md` (outdated — referenced Capacitor, @hello-pangea/dnd, old file paths)
- `.claude/plans/buzzing-booping-llama-agent-*.md` (outdated animation plan — most items already implemented)

## [2.13.0] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Leads PUT full overwrite** → partial update pattern (prevents wiping aiDraft on edit)
- **Finance PUT full overwrite** → partial update pattern (prevents wiping fields on partial edit)
- **Plans PUT full overwrite** → partial update pattern (prevents wiping features)
- **7 frontend PUT calls sending full objects** → only send changed fields (WorkPage drag/move/priority/due, WorkMemoList toggle/edit, LeadsBoard drag/move)
- **Mobile kanban personal tab unreachable** → workTab check renders WorkMemoList when "个人" selected
- **Client PUT log referencing undefined `name`** → use `body.name`
- **WorkMemoList useMemo missing `scope` dependency** → added to dependency array
- **Weekly report `tasksCompleted` counting all-time** → filtered by `updated_at` within week range
- **useAppSettings using raw `fetch()`** → migrated to `api.ts` utility (BUSINESS_RULES Rule 9)
- **InlinePopover z-index using toasts layer (800)** → corrected to popover layer (600)

### Changed
- **Task/Memo layout separation**: memo section now renders above kanban with clear divider, task controls grouped below
- **Memo item interaction (Google Tasks style)**: removed tiny edit/delete icon buttons; tap row → inline edit mode with title/date/time + save/cancel/delete; tap circle → toggle done
- **Checkbox tap target**: increased from 28px to 44px with negative margins for mobile usability
- **PopoverOption touch target**: `py-2` → `py-2.5` (~37px → ~41px)
- **safe-area-inset-bottom**: applied to `.pb-safe`, mobile bottom nav, and BottomSheet for iPhone home indicator

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Pull-to-refresh on ClientListPage and LeadsPage via event bridge pattern
- `searchTimerRef` useRef-based debounce for search inputs (replaces global `window.__searchT` pattern)

### Changed

### Added
- Shared API client utility (`src/lib/api.ts`) with typed `get/post/put/patch/del` methods and `ApiError` class
- RLS migration `001_split_rls_policies.sql`: per-operation policies (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) for all 12 tables
- RLS migration `002_soft_delete_rls_guard.sql`: automatic `soft_deleted = false` filter on SELECT for 8 tables
- Cross-table RLS validation: `payment_milestones` INSERT/UPDATE verifies `client_id` belongs to current user
- Window type declarations for debounce timers (`__cliSearchT`, `__finSearchT`)
- 14 new unit tests (format, cn, api client) — total: 6 files, 57 tests
- Rollback safety net for milestone creation (deletes milestone if finance tx fails)
- `destroySyncManager()` cleanup function with proper auth subscription disposal

### Changed
- **TypeScript `any` eliminated**: 653 → 5 justified instances across 50+ files
  - i18n `TKey` widened to `KnownKey | (string & {})` — removes 580 `as any` casts
  - `TabId` exported from `useUIStore` — removes `setActiveTab("x" as any)` pattern
  - 20+ new interfaces in LeadsBoard, supabase-api, TransactionList, WorkPage, FinancePage
  - All `[key: string]: any` index signatures → `[key: string]: unknown`
- **Empty catch blocks**: 30 of 78 now log `console.warn('[Module]', e)` for debugging
- `validate.ts`: `str()` and `enumVal()` emit dev-mode warnings on truncation/fallback
- Supabase fetch timeout: auth endpoints 8s → 15s; data endpoints remain 8s
- Offline queue: 409/429 now treated as retryable (was permanent failure); user notified on permanent failures via `sync-status` event
- All Framer Motion animations switched from cubic-bezier to `spring(stiffness: 320, damping: 30)`

### Fixed
- InlinePopover trigger: `<div onClick>` → `<button>` with `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, keyboard accessible
- PopoverOption: added `role="option"`, `aria-selected`, checkmark `aria-hidden`
- Popover panel: added `role="listbox"`
- Toast action button: added `aria-label`
- Avatar fallback alt text: empty string → `"User avatar"`
